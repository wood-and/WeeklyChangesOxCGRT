As published on the Victorian Government COVID-19 website, and in
response to reducing levels of community transmission of COVID-19,
restriction for both Greater Melbourne and the rest/regional Victoria
were, overall/in general, relaxed from 11:59pm on Thursday 17 June 2021.
For Victoria The Workplace Directions (No. 33) come into force at
11.59pm 17 June 2021 and replace the Workplace Directions (No. 32).
These directions commence at 11:59:00pm on 17 June 2021 and end at
11:59:00pm on 24 June 2021. Under these new directions no workplaces are
required to close. However, there are a range of restrictions on the
operations of different workplaces. For example: Hospitality: “Open with
COVIDSafe requirements: density quotient of one per two square metres. A
hospitality venue can host up to 25 patrons before the density quotient
apply. Electronic record keeping must be used.” Retail: “Open with
COVIDSafe requirements: density quotient of one per two square metres.
Record keeping required where practical and electronic preferred.” Full
details available at links. Therefore, change to a 1T code.
